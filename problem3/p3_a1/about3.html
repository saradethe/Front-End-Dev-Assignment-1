  <p class="about-p"> SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, was founded in 1955 to advance
    light-based technologies.

    Serving 255,000 constituents from 183 countries, the not-for-profit society advances emerging technologies through
    interdisciplinary information exchange, continuing education, publications, patent precedent, and career and
    professional growth.

    SPIE annually organizes and sponsors approximately 25 major technical forums, exhibitions, and education programs in
    North America, Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific, where more than 35,000 scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs
    showcase the latest innovations across a wide range of technologies.

    SPIE publishes the SPIE Digital Library, the worldâ€™s largest collection of optics and photonics applied research
    with more than 500,000 papers from SPIE journals, conference proceedings and presentations, and eBooks. Research
    spans biomedicine, communications, sensors, defense and security, manufacturing, electronics, energy, and imaging.

    Over the past five years, SPIE has contributed more than $22 million to the international optics community through
    our advocacy and support, including scholarships, educational resources, travel grants, endowed gifts, and
    public-policy development.

    Membership includes Fellows and Senior Member programs. The Society has named more than 1,500 SPIE Members as
    Fellows since 1955, and implemented its Senior Member program in 2008.

    The SPIE awards program serves to recognize outstanding contributions from individuals throughout the scientific
    community.

    The SPIE international office is located in Bellingham, Washington and the SPIE Europe office is located in Cardiff,
    Wales. Contact us.

    The collective talents of our Members make SPIE a powerful force in the scientific community. SPIE Committees
    develop strategic policy and help to foster interaction and cooperation and deepen the Board's understanding of the
    issues that have an impact on the Society.

    Committee members must be current SPIE voting members, commit to serving a three-year term, able to devote the
    necessary time to the committee's work, and generally attend two committee meetings per year. Student Members are
    welcome to participate as non-voting members.

    SPIE is a not-for-profit educational society organized to advance emerging light-based technologies through
    interdisciplinary information exchange, continuing education, publications, career development, and advocacy.

    SPIE provides free or low-cost distribution of articles published in the SPIE Digital Library to scientists at
    institutions in least-developed or low-income countries through the eJDS program of the International Centre for
    Theoretical Physics.
    SPIE makes the complete SPIE Digital Library available to high schools for free and to two-year colleges at a
    subsidized price.
