      <td>22-10-22</td>
      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">At SPIE Optics + Photonics 2022, Oana Jurchescu of Wake Forest
        University will offer answers to the question "can solution-processed organic thin-film transistors enable
        ubiquitous electronics?" Here she discusses her work with organic and hybrid electronic materials and devices.we
        study the structure and function relationships that define the interconversions between light, excitons, spins,
        and charge carriers in these materials, as well as the processes occurring at heterointerfaces involving
        them.The growing demands for smaller and faster electronics have sparked the need for new componentry
        technologies. Molecular devices could address this challenge and complement the conventional silicon-based
        industry with smaller, cheaper, and more versatile applications. One of the simplest structures is represented
        by the molecular diode. This project aims at understanding charge transport mechanisms in molecular devices and
        developing efficient current rectifiers by exploiting structure-property relationships.</td>

      <td>07-11-22</td>
      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">As a graduate student at ETH Zürich, Lisa Poulikakos became
        fascinated by the optical properties of biological matter as she studied the chirality (i.e. the left- or
        right-handedness) of biological molecules and how nanophotonics can uniquely enhance the optical detection of
        this subtle yet essential structural feature. “This project sparked my interest in the interplay of form and
        function in biological matter more generally,” says Poulikakos, now an assistant professor at the University of
        California, San Diego (UCSD) and recipient of the 2022 Beckman Young Investigator award. “I subsequently learned
        about the rich palette of medical challenges associated with the fibrous properties of biological tissue, as
        well as the tradeoffs in precision, cost and time faced in this field. I then initiated a new branch of research
        which investigates the great potential of colorimetric metasurfaces to enhance and enable the quantitative
        characterization of tissue microstructure in a rapid, non-destructive, low-cost, and label-free manner.”</td>

      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">Exploring the frontier of light-matter interactions</td>
      <td>13-11-22</td>
      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">It's a super exciting field, and its discovery potential and
        impact will remain strong for years to come,” says Jun Ye, leader of the Ye Group at JILA, a joint institute of
        the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) and the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST). The
        “super exciting” field he’s referencing is quantum science and metrology. Ye will be discussing recent
        developments in the field, including precise engineering of quantum states of matter and innovative laser
        technology, at SPIE Optics + Photonics 2022.We build optical atomic clocks based on confining ultracold atoms or
        atomic quantum gas in optical lattices. These modern atomic clocks combine precision measurement and quantum
        science in a single platform, and they are pushing the frontiers of measurement science and quantum metrology.

        We also study molecules in the quantum regime, where the quantum mechanical wavefunctions of individual
        molecules overlap with each other, creating novel dynamics mediated by molecular interactions. Cooling molecules
        to quantum degeneracy, just as the scientific community achieved on atoms in the late 90s, has provided a vast
        array of new opportunities for manipulating more complex matter, shedding new insights to emergent quantum
        phenomena, precision measurement that touches on fundamental physics and new quantum chemistry.</td>

      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V</td>
      <td>20-11-22</td>
      <td style="color: white; background-color: grey;">Derive a great deal of satisfaction out of knowing that
        instruments I've helped build have made it possible for many others to do their science,” says Richard Pogge.
        The College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Astronomy at Ohio State University (OSU) is talking
        about working on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V), the first dual-hemisphere, multi-epoch, optical and
        infrared astronomical survey providing multi-object and integral field spectroscopy across the Milky Way and
        other galaxies. "One big reason is SDSS makes their data public, which enables an enormous range of science by
        the community, often in areas the core project team never thought of."

        Pogge, project lead of the Focal Plane Systems for SDSS-V, will be part of a plenary panel at SPIE Astronomical
        Telescopes + Instrumentation in Montréal discussing the project’s new instrumentation, including a new
        three-element, wide-field corrector for the SDSS 2.5m telescope; dual multi-fiber robotic focal plane systems;
        and a new facility with four small telescopes and three fiber-fed optical spectrographs for integral field
        observations.</td>
